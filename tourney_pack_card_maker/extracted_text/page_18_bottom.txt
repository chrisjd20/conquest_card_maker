Player does the same. It is possible that the Second 
Player has chosen the same Objective Zone as the 
First Player.

the Objective Zone they selected at the end of that 
Round’s Victory Phase.

VPs as follows:
● Players gain 1 VP for Seizing an Objective Zone.
● Players gain an additional 2 VPs if they are Seizing 
two or more Objective Zones.
Game Length
The game ends at the end of the 10th Round. The Player 
that has scored the most VP’s is declared the winner.
