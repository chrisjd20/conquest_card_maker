Setting up the Battlefield
Place five 6" Objective Zones as shown in the diagram.
Scenario Special Rules
At the end of each Supremacy Phase, the First Player 
secretly chooses an Objective Zone, other than the 
central one. Then the Second Player does the same. 
It is possible that the Second Player has chosen the 
same Objective Zone as the First Player. 
To ensure the selection remains secret players may write 
their selection onto a folded piece of paper or hide an 
amount of dice/Command Cards/ markers equal to 
the number of the Objective Zone they have selected. 
At the start of the Victory Phase, both players reveal 
which Objective Zone they have chosen. Until the end 
of the Round, Players do not gain Victory Points for 
Seizing those Objective Zones. Should both Players have 
chosen the same Objective Zone then that Objective 
Zone awards double the amount of Victory Points.
Victory Points
During the Victory Phase of each Round Players gain 
VPs as follows:
● Players gain 2 VPs for each Objective Zone they 
are Seizing.
● Players gain an additional 2 VPs if they are Seizing 
two Objective Zones, not including the central one.
● Players gain an additional 1 VP if they are Seizing 
the central Objective Zone.
Game Length
The game ends at the end of the 10th Round. The Player 
that has scored the most VPs is declared the winner.
